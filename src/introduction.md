# Introduction

NetAuth is a secure authentication and authorization provider for
small to medium scale installations.  It provides a complete directory
solution suitable for Linux systems operated in a domain-style
environment and is suitable as a backend identity provider for
arbitrary systems.

Key features of NetAuth include:

  * Only one binary for the authentication and authorization provider.
    This greatly simplifies deployment, upgrades, and management.
  * Simple and easy to use control binaries that do the right thing.
  * Documentation that is not from a defunct company.
  * An easy to build for RPC interface based on gRPC.
